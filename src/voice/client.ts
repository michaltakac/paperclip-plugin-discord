/**
 * Discord voice client (Phase 1, STT inbound only).
 *
 * Joins a Discord voice channel via @discordjs/voice using the custom gateway
 * adapter from ./discord-adapter.ts. For each speaker, listens for an Opus
 * stream that ends after 800 ms of silence (the silence detection IS the VAD —
 * no separate VAD library), decodes to PCM via prism-media, transcribes via
 * Deepgram, hands the utterance to the plugin's inbound ingress, and posts the
 * transcript into a text channel by webhook so the room can see what was heard.
 *
 * The webhook post is DISPLAY ONLY. Nothing re-reads it: the utterance reaches
 * Paperclip through `ingestUtterance`, never by being routed back in as a
 * message. A transcript therefore cannot loop, and the inbound router keeps its
 * trust boundary — no webhook is ever accepted as a message source.
 *
 * Out of scope for Phase 1: TTS outbound (Phase 2), per-agent voice lookup
 * (Phase 2), cost guard (Phase 3), latency CI checks (Phase 4).
