// starts: an unscoped `ctx.config.get()` in setup() throws and kills activation.
//
// setup() therefore only registers handlers. Everything that needs config or a
// secret lives in this runtime, and `onConfigChanged` is the ONLY thing that
// starts it: the host delivers stored configuration with its company scope —
// replayed at worker start from v2026.817.0 (paperclipai/paperclip#10092), and
// on every save on every host.
//
// An invocation never bootstraps. It cannot establish ownership the host would
// agree with: `config.get` does not move the SDK's recorded company, so a
// runtime adopted from an invocation would own an install the SDK still
// considers unowned, and on a fresh install it would adopt an empty `{}` row
// while the SDK's owner stayed null. Invocations only ever read the runtime a
// delivery already established.
//
// Ownership follows the host: the first company whose configuration arrives owns
// this install, and any other company is logged and refused — except for the
// host's own equal-config rule, mirrored in `claimOwnership`.
// `multiCompanyConfig` stays unset, so the host also fails a second company's
// config closed rather than rebinding this worker.
